# World Marriage Dataset Analysis

This project explores global patterns in marital status using a real-world dataset. We use Python and popular data analysis libraries to uncover insights about marriage, divorce, and single status across different countries, genders, and age groups.

---

## Objective

To analyze how marital status varies across:
- Gender
- Age groups
- Countries
- Time periods (start and end years)

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 
- Pandas & NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (LabelEncoder)

---

## Dataset

- **File**: `World_Marriage_Dataset.csv`
- **Features include**:
  - Country
  - Sex
  - Marital Status
  - Age Group
  - Data Collection Years (Start & End)
  - Data Processed Count

---

## Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed duplicates
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Marital status distribution overall and by gender
   - Trends over time (start year)
   - Age group analysis
3. **Outlier Detection**
   - Boxplots to find anomalies in data collection years by age group
4. **Encoding Categorical Features**
   - Label encoded features like Gender, Marital Status, Country
5. **Correlation Matrix**
   - Analyzed correlation between encoded features

---

## Visualizations Included

- Count plots (Marital Status overall and by gender)
- Line plots (Marital trends over time)
- Count plots across age groups
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Heatmap (Correlation matrix)

---

## Insights

- The majority of individuals are **single**, followed by **married** and **divorced**.
- **Females** show a higher percentage in the **divorced** category compared to males.
- **Marriage and divorce rates** have fluctuated over the years.
- **Younger individuals** are mostly **single**, while **older age groups** are more likely to be **married**.
